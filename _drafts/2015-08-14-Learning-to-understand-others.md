Listening to Jeffrey Zeldman speak at the DC An Event Apart conference, I realized that him and I had something in common. We both feel like we're sometimes misunderstood. Does that happen to you? It happens to me all of the time. I've always blamed it on two very distinct characteristics of my personality. 

1. I talk too much
2. I often say what I think

I grew up thinking that this is what people wanted to hear...no, what they needed to hear, but after being in the workplace for a long time, I began to realize that strangely enough, people don't always say what they mean. I'm not sure why, but this was shocking to learn as a young adult and definitely. Something that was very confusing to me when I learned to speak English is that some people use language loosely, but others want things to be precise. 

I'll give you an example. When I was learning English, I thought 'a couple' mean an indeterminate amount greater than one. I heard it so many times..."This will take a couple of minutes" or "can I have a couple of your Skittles?". It never meant two literally. I learned a lot of English by context, so I eventually started to say 'a couple' when I really meant some or a few. Eventually, I learned that it actually meant two, but sometimes if a third Skittle made it into someone else's mouth, that was OK, but somehow when I tried to get a third Skittle some people would remind me of the true meaning of the words.

Because of the way that I talk and probably somewhat due to the way I look (I don't have a warm soft smile), I learned that some people misinterpret what I say or add things to what I meant. That is seldom the case, most of the time I'm trying to communicate effectively.
