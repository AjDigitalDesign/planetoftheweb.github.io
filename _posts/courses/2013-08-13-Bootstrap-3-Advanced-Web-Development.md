synopsis:
description: "Generate your own interactive website from scratch with Bootstrap, the mobile-friendly framework from Twitter, in this start-to-finish course with developer and author Ray Villalobos. First, you'll plan and prototype the interface with MindMaps and Balsamiq Mockups. Next, download Bootstrap and dive into organizing your site structure with its scaffolding feature—adding PHP includes to break your code into reusable modules and building in the core navigation. Ray then shows you how to build interactive carousels, modal features, and forms, and control these features with JavaScript. Finally, learn to style it all with LESS and prepare to publish the results online."
