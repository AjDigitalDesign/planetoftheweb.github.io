JavaScript is the language for adding interactivity to a website, but there's so much more it can do. Enter Node.js and Express.js, two technologies that extend the capabilities of JavaScript. The Node platform allows you to develop server-side applications with JavaScript that you can then easily publish as websites with the Express framework. In this course, Ray Villalobos walks through the entire process of creating a website on a server with Node.js and Express.js. After going over the installation process, Ray shows how to build a basic application, control the state of an application with routing, and use templates and partials. Then he demonstrates how to quickly structure a site with Express Generator, work with models and views, and publish the final website using Heroku.
