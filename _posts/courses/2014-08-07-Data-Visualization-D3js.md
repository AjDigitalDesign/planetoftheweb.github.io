Creating data-driven visualizations and infographics that run on multiple devices responsively is a tough challenge. The D3.js library has revolutionized visualization by making it easier to parse your data and add meaningful interactivity. All you need to bring your data to life is D3, plus a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and some SVG graphics. In this course staff author Ray Villalobos explores how the D3 library works, and how you can use it to parse data from different sources and create interactive, visually exciting infographics and visualizations. He'll review the basics—controlling HTML with jQuery-esque selections and customizing attributes with D3's CSS-like language—before moving on to working with SVG graphics, the best choice for graphics in D3 visualizations. He'll also cover working with D3 methods like scaling, events, transitions, and animations; data manipulation (including connecting to external data sources); and creating different types of layouts, including a draggable force-driven layout.

### Topics include

- Creating a basic document structure
