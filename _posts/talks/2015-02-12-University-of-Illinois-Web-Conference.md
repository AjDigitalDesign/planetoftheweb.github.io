## Building Semantic & Responsive Grids with Sass & Compass
### PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP
- **date:** Wednesday, April 29, 2-5 p.m.
- **location:** Lincoln Room

Building responsive grids with plain CSS can be challenging. Dealing with media queries, fractional widths and browser prefixes often prevent a designer from taking advantage from newer features like Flexbox, responsive grids and with Mobile-first design. Plus, Frameworks like Bootstrap can leave undesirable non-semantic layout code in your markup. In this session, we'll build a hotel website for the Landon Hotel using Sass along with Compass and two other libraries that will make designing semantic markup faster, easier and more efficient. You'll discover that using the right tools will make designing your sites unbelievably fun again.
