## Building Single Page Animated Sites With Sass & Scrollview
### Afternoon Workshop
- **date:** Wednesday, June 24, 1:30-5 p.m.

In this hands-on workshop, we'll explore how to build a responsive, single page website using time-saving workflow tools like gulp.js, git and github. We'll explore how to work with Sass and related libraries like Susy, Breakpoint and Compass to take advantage of some advanced features like prefix-free css, nesting, mixins, @includes and more. Then, we'll take a look at how to achieve different animated effects like docking your navigation, scrolling to a position, and creating tweens and other scroll effects using jQuery and ScollMagic. This workshop will be approximately 30% Lecture and 70% hands-on, so come with your laptop and be ready to code.

We'll also be taking some time to explore different animation techniques with scrollview and GSOCK, which allow you to create all kinds of animation effects including tweens, parallax scrolling and mouse controlled movement.

#### Prerequisites 

Although we'll spend some time setting things up, you should have some experience using GitHub Projects. If you can, try installing git, ruby, and node.js before the workshop. Take a look at these setup resources
