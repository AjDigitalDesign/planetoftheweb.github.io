## Mastering Responsive Single Page Bootstrap Layouts
- **date:** Wednesday, March 28, 11:30am-12:30pm
- **location:** Lincoln Room

Boostrap is a great timesaver, but one of the great complaints is that too many sites that use it the look the same. Yet the framework has all of the tools you need to build responsive sites with complex layouts. In this session Lynda.com I'll show you how to go beyond the basics and learn what you need to create responsive, single page designs with features like:

- Complex multicolumn Layouts using Bootstrap's built in classes
- Designs that adjust to different screen sizes
- A responsive, full screen carousel that fades instead of slides
- Navigation that changes as you scroll into content
- Links that scroll to a position on the page with smooth effects Want to take a peek?
