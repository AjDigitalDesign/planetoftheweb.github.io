## Three weeks of JavaScript Training
- **date:** June 1-19

JavaScript provides functionality to websites. HTML5 holds content, CSS3 formats it, and JavaScript allows us to manipulate it. Our bootcamp training will build upon the basics and cover the essentials of today's best-practices.

Some of the topics that will be covered at our JavaScript bootcamp include: JavaScript Essentials, Functions, Enhancing the DOM, Events, JavaScript and JSON, JavaScript and AJAX, and also if time permits Web Project Workflows, optimizing development on sublime, and slack. Our bootcamp will provide plenty of opportunities for "hands-on" practice. See the full outline of the schedule here: Week 02, Week 03, Week 04
