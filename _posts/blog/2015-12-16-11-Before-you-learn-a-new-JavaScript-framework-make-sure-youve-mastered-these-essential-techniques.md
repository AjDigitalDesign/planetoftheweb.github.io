Being a front end developer can be tough...and that's because there are way too many things that distract us. The new shiny new framework that promises to help us do our work faster, more efficiently and in less time takes a lot of time to learn and even longer to master. Often, by the time you learn it, the world has already moved to something else.

Before you go learning the next killer framework that's revolutionizing web development, make sure you take the time to master these JavaScript fundamentals. They will help you learn frameworks quicker and give you a foundation that you can use regardless of what framework you end up coding in.

## Functional programming

JavaScript at it's core is fundamental a functional language. It's one of the things that makes the language strange and awesome at the same time. In order to be successful, you have to learn some of the techniques that make it different. Things like scope, objects, closures, modules, this, prototypes and more are critical things to not just explore, but to have some experience with.


## The DOM

More and more libraries like AngularJS and React change the way you think about the DOM (Document Object Model), so before you spend time working with those, make sure you get a chance to master what the DOM is and learn how to tame it to your will. There's a lot of really interesting techniques you should know including how to create, insert, delete and modify DOM nodes and content through `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`. If you're still accessing elements with `getElementByID` or managing DOM elements through [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) or [Sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com/), then DOM access has evolved dramatically.


## Events

JavaScript without events is like eating a BLT without the Bacon. In order to master Events, you need to learn about event propagation, registration, properties, how to cancel events and default behaviors. Learning how to work with click events is elemental, but you should also learn about time based events like loading media and how playing audio and video. Events can be deceptively easy to learn, but hard to master.


## AJAX

AJAX or Asychronous JavaScript and XML doesn't have much to do with XML anymore, but it has everything to do with how we build dynamic web applications. It gives you the ability to load data and modify the DOM without requiring a page reload. In newer browsers, AJAX has become significantly easier to work with. Learn both how to use AJAX with and without jQuery. AJAX is also more powerful when you understand JavaScript Objects and JSON, so make sure that you learn about those as well.


## JSON

JSON is a text format for reading data into many different languages. It's perfect for working with JavaScript because it translates easily to a JavaScript Object, which is a slightly different thing altogether. You need to know the differences between JSON and an Object, how to translate one to the other and how you can use AJAX with JSON to load content dynamically. For some extra credit, learn about NoSQL databases like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) that store data in the JSON format.
